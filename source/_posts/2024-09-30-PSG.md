# Pseudo-Global Warming (PGW)

## Definition and Concept

Pseudo-Global Warming (PGW) is a regional climate modeling approach that involves imposing large-scale climate changes derived from global climate models (GCMs) onto a control regional climate simulation. This method contrasts with traditional dynamic downscaling, where regional models are driven directly by GCM outputs. Instead, PGW modifies the boundary conditions of a historical simulation to reflect projected future changes, allowing for a more flexible and computationally efficient analysis of climate impacts

To perform future projections using the **Pseudo-Global Warming (PGW)** approach, follow these key steps:

## Methodology for PGW Projections

### **1. Understanding PGW Concept**
The PGW method involves modifying historical climate simulations by imposing future climate changes directly onto them. This is achieved by adjusting the boundary conditions of a control simulation based on projected changes derived from global climate models (GCMs).

### **2. Mathematical Representation**
The PGW approach can be mathematically expressed as:

$$
\text{PGW} = \text{HIST} + \Delta
$$

where:

- **HIST** represents the current or historical climate conditions.
- **Δ** (Delta) is the perturbation derived from future climate projections, 

calculated as:

$$
\Delta = \text{SCEN} - \text{CTRL}
$$

Here, **SCEN** is a future climate scenario, and **CTRL** is the corresponding historical baseline.

  - In the second PGW experiment, human‐induced perturbations are computed as the monthly averages of the **30‐year (1986–2005)** mean differences between historical and historicalNat runs of CMIP5 seven‐model ensemblemean.

  - Both SCEN and HIST periods must be chosen to be long enough to reduce the effects of internal variability (average of ∼ 30 years). 
  - After applying Δ to the thermodynamic variables, it is thus essential to restore this balance using an adequate pressure adjustment

  - The perturbation fields Delta are meant to be based on 30-year monthly means of the driving GCM. The required GCM fields include three-dimensional fields of temperature, specific humidity and wind (T, qv, u, v), as well as the geopotential height field (phi) on at least one pressure level. Monthly mean changes of these fields are linearly interpolated to the target date, and then merged with ERA5 information.

### **3. Data Requirements**
To implement PGW, you need:

- Historical climate data (e.g., from reanalysis datasets like ERA5).
- Future climate projections from GCMs, typically focusing on thermodynamic and dynamic variables such as temperature, humidity, wind, and geopotential height.

### **4. Simulation Setup**

- **Select a GCM**: Choose a transient GCM that provides future climate scenarios relevant to your region of interest.
- **Derive Δ**: Compute the perturbations (Δ) based on 30-year monthly means from the GCM outputs.
- **Modify Boundary Conditions**: Apply Δ to the historical data to create new boundary conditions for your regional climate model (RCM) simulations.

### **5. Running Simulations**

- Execute the RCM with the modified boundary conditions. The PGW approach allows for shorter simulation periods (less than 30 years), which can be beneficial for high-resolution climate projections.
- Ensure that interannual variability is not included in these projections since PGW assumes a consistent seasonal cycle.

### **6. Analyzing Results**
After running the simulations:

- Assess changes in key climate variables such as temperature, precipitation, and extreme weather events.
- Compare results with traditional dynamic downscaling methods to validate the PGW approach's effectiveness in capturing plausible future scenarios.

## Advantages of PGW

- **Computational Efficiency**: PGW requires less computational power compared to traditional methods, making it suitable for high-resolution studies.
- **Flexibility**: It allows researchers to easily modify simulation parameters and assess various future scenarios.

## Challenges and Considerations

Despite its advantages, implementing PGW poses challenges:

- **Complexity of Implementation**: Care must be taken to ensure that modifications do not compromise the physical realism of the regional model. Adjustments to pressure and geopotential fields are critical for maintaining consistency between thermodynamic and dynamic changes.
- **Interannual Variability**: The PGW method typically does not account for changes in interannual variability, which can limit its applicability in certain contexts.
- **Sensitivity to Initial Conditions**: The effectiveness of PGW simulations can be sensitive to the choice of initial conditions and boundary settings, necessitating careful calibration.

By following this structured methodology, researchers can effectively utilize the PGW approach to project future climate conditions while addressing specific regional impacts of global warming.


## Step-by-Step Process of Pseudo-Global Warming (PGW) Using CMIP6

The Pseudo-Global Warming (PGW) approach is a method for simulating future climate scenarios by modifying existing regional climate models (RCMs) using data from global climate models (GCMs). Below is a detailed step-by-step process using CMIP6 as an example.

#### **Step 1: Select a Global Climate Model (GCM)**

Choose a suitable GCM from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6). For instance, you might select the CanESM5 model, which provides multiple ensemble runs to capture internal variability.

#### **Step 2: Obtain Historical and Future Climate Data**

- **Historical Data (CTRL)**: Gather historical climate data for a baseline period (e.g., 1971-2000) from the selected GCM.
- **Future Scenario Data (SCEN)**: Obtain future climate projections for a specific scenario (e.g., SSP2-4.5) from the same GCM for a future period (e.g., 2071-2100).

#### **Step 3: Calculate the Perturbation Field (Δ)**

Compute the perturbation field that represents the changes between the future scenario and the historical control:

$$
\Delta = SCEN - CTRL
$$

This field will include changes in key variables such as temperature, specific humidity, wind, and geopotential height. The perturbations should be based on monthly mean data over a defined period to ensure consistency with seasonal cycles .

#### **Step 4: Prepare Historical Simulation (HIST)**

Run a historical simulation using an RCM with boundary conditions derived from reanalysis data (e.g., ERA5). This simulation will serve as the control run for your PGW experiment.

#### **Step 5: Modify Boundary Conditions**

Add the perturbation field Δ to the historical boundary conditions to create new lateral boundary conditions for the PGW simulation:

$$
PGW = HIST + \Delta
$$

This step ensures that the PGW simulation incorporates both thermodynamic and dynamic changes while preserving physical realism .

#### **Step 6: Run PGW Simulation**

Execute the PGW simulation using the modified boundary conditions. This simulation will reflect how historical weather patterns might evolve under future climate scenarios. The synoptic environment will closely match that of the reanalysis data, reducing biases typical in conventional downscaling methods .

#### **Step 7: Analyze Results**

After running the PGW simulation, analyze the outputs to assess changes in climate variables, such as temperature and precipitation patterns. This analysis can help evaluate potential impacts on local ecosystems, water resources, and extreme weather events.

#### **Step 8: Validate Against Observations**

Compare the PGW simulation results with observed climate data to validate accuracy. This step is crucial for ensuring that the model captures realistic climate dynamics and can be used for impact assessments.
