# Characteristics of turbulence

One characteristic of turbulent flows is their **irregularity** (or **randomness**). A fully deterministic approach to characterize turbulent flows is very difficult. Turbulent flows are usually described statistically.

- The **diffusivity** of turbulence cause rapid mixing and increased rates of momentum, heat, and mass transfer. A flow that looks random but does not exhibit the spreading of velocity fluctuations through the surrounding fluid is not turbulent.
- Turbulent flows are **dissipative**. Kinetic energy gets converted into heat due to viscous shear stresses. Turbulent flows die out quickly when no energy is supplied.
- Turbulent flows always occur at **high Reynolds numbers**. They are caused by a complex interaction between the viscous forces and convection.
- Turbulent flows are rotational, that is, they have **non-zero vorticity**. Mechanisms such as the stretching of three-dimensional vortices play a key role in turbulence.
- Turbulence is a **continuum phenomenon**. Even the smallest eddies are significantly larger than the molecular scales.
- Turbulence is a **feature of flow and is not a property of the fluid**. A liquid or a gas at high Reynolds number will exhibit the same dynamics.

1. **Turbulent flows can originate at the walls**. When this is the case, we talk about `wall bounded turbulence`.
2. **Turbulent flows can also originate in the absence of walls (or far from walls)**. When this is the case, we talk about `shear free turbulence` (usually **jets, heated walls, atmospheric flows**).

# Instantaneous fluctuations â€“ Removing small scales

We have seen that turbulent flows are characterize by instantaneous fluctuations of velocity, pressure, and all
transported quantities.

- In most engineering applications is not of interest resolving the instantaneous fluctuations.
- To avoid the need to resolve the instantaneous fluctuations (or small scales), two methods can be used:
  - **Reynolds averaging**.
  - **Filtering**.
- If you want to resolve all scales, you conduct DNS simulations, which are very computationally intensive.
- Two methods can be used to eliminate the need to resolve the small scales:
  - **Reynolds averaging (RANS/URANS)**:
    - All turbulence scales are modeled.
    - Can be 2D and 3D.
    - Can be steady or unsteady.
  - **Filtering (LES/DES)**:
    - Resolves large eddies.
    - Models small eddies.
    - Intrinsically 3D and unsteady.
- Both methods introduce additional terms in the governing equations that must be
modeled (these terms are related to the instantaneous fluctuations).
- The final goal of turbulence modeling is to find the closure equations to model these
additional terms (usually a stress tensor).

# Reynolds Averaging

{% note primary %}
**Averaging the quantities (time average, spatial average or ensemble average)**
{% endnote %}

- Reynolds averaging simple consists in:
  - Splitting the instantaneous value of the primitive variables into a mean component and a fluctuating component (Reynolds decomposition).
  - **Averaging the quantities (time average, spatial average or ensemble average)**.
  - Applying a few averaging rules to simplify the equations
  - When we use Reynolds averaging, we are taking a statistical approach to turbulence
modeling.

1. **RANS (Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes)**: Time averaging
2. **URANS (Unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes)**: Ensemble averaging

## Time averaging
{% note primary %}
**Time averaging is appropriate for stationary turbulence or slowly varying turbulent flows.**
{% endnote %}

$$
\bar{\phi}(\mathbf{x})=\lim _{T \rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{T} \int_t^{t+T} \phi(\mathbf{x}, t) d t
$$

## Spatial averaging
{% note primary %}
**Spatial averaging is appropriate for homogenous turbulence.**
{% endnote %}

$$
\bar{\phi}(t)=\lim _{V \rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{V} \int_V \phi(\mathrm{x}, t) d V
$$

## Ensemble averaging 
{% note primary %}
**Ensemble averaging is appropriate for unsteady turbulence.**
{% endnote %}

- In ensemble averaging, **the number or realizations (or experiments) must be large enough** to eliminate the effects of fluctuations. This type of averaging can be used with steady or unsteady flows.
- If you can afford it, ensemble averaging is recommended. Have in mind that CFD is deterministic, **so you should start each realization using different initial conditions and boundary conditions fluctuations to obtain different outcomes**.

$$
\bar{\phi}(\mathrm{x}, t)=\lim _{ N \rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \phi(\mathrm{x}, t)
$$

## Averaging rules

![](https://i.imgur.com/l3vVmDc.png){width=600}

# Ex: 1D Burgers equation

Consider the 1D Burgers equation in terms of the velocity field $u(x, t)$
$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}+\frac{\partial u^{2} / 2}{\partial x}=\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left(v \frac{\partial u}{\partial x}\right) \tag{1}
\end{equation*}
$$

## LES

In the continuous **LES approach the scale separation is obtained via low-pass filtering**. The spatial filtering operation (no time-filtering is considered here) can be expressed as the convolution product between the unfiltered point-wise velocity field and some suitable filter function $G$, that is
$$
\begin{equation*}
\bar{u}(x, t ; \Delta)=\int_{R} G\left(x-x^{\prime} ; \Delta\right) u\left(x^{\prime}, t\right) d x^{\prime} \tag{2}
\end{equation*}
$$
$\Delta$ being the characteristic filter width. The LES equation is obtained by applying (2) to each term of (1)
$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\partial \bar{u}}{\partial t}+\frac{\partial \bar{u}^{2} / 2}{\partial x}=\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left(v \frac{\partial \bar{u}}{\partial x}\right)+\underbrace{\frac{\partial\left(\bar{u}^{2}-u^{2}\right) / 2}{\partial x}}_{\frac{\partial f(\bar{u}, u)}{\partial x}} \tag{3}
\end{equation*}
$$

Commutation between filtering and derivative being applied

## URANS

As a counterpart, in the continuous **URANS approach a statistical averaging** is adopted.
$$
\begin{equation*}
\langle u\rangle(x, t)=\lim _{N \rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{N} \sum_{k=1}^{N} u_{k}(x, t) \tag{4}
\end{equation*}
$$


$N$ being the **number of sample of the ensemble averaging**. The URANS equation is obtained by applying (4) to each term of (1)

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\partial\langle u\rangle}{\partial t}+\frac{\partial\langle u\rangle^{2} / 2}{\partial x}=\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left(v \frac{\partial\langle u\rangle}{\partial x}\right)+\underbrace{\frac{\partial\left(\langle u\rangle^{2}-u^{2}\right) / 2}{\partial x}}_{\frac{\partial g(\langle u\rangle, u)}{\partial x}} \tag{5}
\end{equation*}
$$

## Close equations

In order to close Eqs.(3) and (5), suitable models are used, that is 

$$
f(\bar{u}, u) \cong f_{\text {LES }}(\bar{u}), \qquad g(\langle u\rangle, u) \cong g_{\text {URANS }}(\langle u\rangle)
$$

## Discretization

If we consider now the practical solution, a discretization of the derivative is introduced. Assume the same discretization is adopted for the LES and URANS equations, so that we can write a unique equation
$$
\frac{\delta u_{j}}{\delta t}+\frac{\delta u_{j}^{2} / 2}{\delta x}=\frac{\delta}{\delta x}\left(v \frac{\delta u_{j}}{\delta x}\right)+\frac{\delta}{\delta x}\left\{\begin{array}{c}
f_{L E S}\left(u_{j}\right)  \tag{6}\\
g_{\text {URANS }}\left(u_{j}\right)
\end{array}\right.
$$
that characterizes LES or URANS depending on the closure model.

{% note primary %}
One can deduce that the discrete equation (6) never implied a real application of a spatial filtering or an ensemble averaging. **The only assessment is the spatial filtering implicitly induced by the discretization, a fact that is congruent to the LES assumption but not to the URANS one**.
{% endnote %}

The Eq.(6) must be well posed by the set of initial and boundary conditions. This point adds a distinction as they should be different for LES and URANS.
