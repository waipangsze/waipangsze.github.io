# Major problem

{% note primary %}
Major problem is that **turbulence parameterizations in the commonly used one-dimensional (1D) planetary boundary layer (PBL) schemes only consider vertical exchange**. 
{% endnote %}

- The [**document**](https://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/wrf/users/tutorial/presentation_pdfs/202101/dudhia_physics_pbl_turbulence.pdf) gives a brief description of LES in WRF, which may also be helpful.

```namelist
km_opt(max_dom)  = 1,	! eddy coefficient option
                    1 = constant (use khdif kvdif)
                    2 = 1.5 order TKE closure (3D)
                    3 = Smagorinsky first order closure (3D)
                        Note: option 2 and 3 are not recommended for DX > 2 km
                    4 = horizontal Smagorinsky first order closure
                        (recommended for real-data cases)
                    5 = SMS-3DTKE scale-adaptive LES/PBL scheme. It must be
                        used with diff_opt = 2. PBL schemes must be turned off
                        (bl_pbl_physics=0). It can work with sf_sfclay_physics = 1, 5, 91.

  - Employing the **`Shuttle Radar Topography Mission 1 arc s dataset (SRTM1; ~30 m)`** high-resolution topographic dataset instead of the **`traditional USGS_30s (~900 m) dataset`** effectively improves the model capability for reproducing fluctuations and turbulent features of surface winds.
  - Numerical artifacts might be produced in areas of complex terrain, where the **assumption of horizontal homogeneity is violated** `(Goger et al. 2018, 2019)` while horizontal exchanges and **three-dimensional (3D) effects** such as horizontal shear production are entirely neglected. 3D PBL schemes `(Jiménez and Kosović 2016)` should be able to alleviate the effect of complex terrain, yet there exist no robust approaches that have been validated in a wide range of atmospheric conditions.
  - In addition, **mesoscale NWP models** with relatively coarse resolution cannot capture microscale variabilities driven by atmospheric dynamics (**turbulence effects are fully parameterized**). **Large-eddy simulation (LES) that can explicitly resolve the most energetic turbulent eddies could be an alternative to PBL schemes** (Cuxart 2015).
