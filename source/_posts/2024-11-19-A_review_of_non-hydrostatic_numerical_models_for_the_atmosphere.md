Three major components are discussed.

- Governing equations
  - Various approximations to governing equations
  - The Boussinesq anelastic and fully compressible treatments
  - Various vertical coordinate systems
- Numerical techniques
  - To handle acoustic and fast moving gravity modes
  - Including semi-implicit and split-explicit time integration schemes to control the acoustic modes
  - Method of defining vertical and lateral boundary conditions are also discussed
- Inclusion of nonlinear physical processes
  - Review inclusion of nonlinear physical processes
