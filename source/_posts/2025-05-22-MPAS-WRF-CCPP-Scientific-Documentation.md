# CCPP Scientific Documentation

![](https://i.imgur.com/MTwxL8Z.png)

The scientific documentation for the parameterizations and suites available in the **Common Community Physics Package (CCPP)**.

The **CCPP-Physics** (available through h<ttps://github.com/NCAR/ccpp-physics/>) is envisioned to contain parameterizations used in the Unified Forecast System (UFS) applications for weather through seasonal prediction timescales, encompassing the current operational GFS schemes, as well as developmental schemes under consideration for upcoming operational implementations. The UFS can be configured for multiple applications, including the UFS Short-Range Weather (SRW) Application (available through <https://github.com/ufs-community/ufs-srweather-app/>), which targets predictions of atmospheric behavior on a limited spatial domain and on time scales from less than an hour out to several days, and the UFS Medium-Range Weather (MRW) Application (available through <https://github.com/ufs-community/ufs-mrweather-app/>)(which targets predictions of global atmospheric behavior out to about two weeks), the Subseasonal-to-Seasonal (S2S) Application (which predicts the Earth System out to several months), and the Hurricane Application (which predicts tropical cyclones).

Both the CCPP Framework and the CCPP Physics are developed as open source code, follow industry-standard code management practices, and are freely distributed through GitHub (<https://github.com/NCAR/ccpp-physics> and <https://github.com/NCAR/ccpp-framework>). This documentation is housed in repository <https://github.com/NCAR/ccpp-doc>.
