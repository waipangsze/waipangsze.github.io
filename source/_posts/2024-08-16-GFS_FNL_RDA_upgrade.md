RDA - Research Data Archive

## RDA Data Services Unavailable July 30, 2024
- July 26, 2024 Posted by: RDA Team

Update on July 31, 2024: standard data file download, THREDDS access, and Globus transfer services have been restored. We continue to resolve issues with data search and subsetting services. Thank you for your patience during this maintenance period.

Due to scheduled updates on the NSF NCAR Research Data Archive, all RDA data access services, including downloads, data subsetting, and THREDDS data server access, will be unavailable July 30, 2024 beginning at 9:00 AM MDT.  We anticipate services to be restored near the end of the day July 30. Please follow our Twitter profile (@NCAR_RDA) for updates.

The primary purpose of the downtime is to update the dataset numbering system for data collections archived in the RDA. After the update, **all RDA datasets will be identified by a dataset number in the format 'dnnnnnn', where 'nnnnnn' is the serial number used to identify a dataset. Until now, dataset numbers have been in the format 'dnnn.n'. This format will be converted to the new format 'dnnn00n', in which the first three digits of the old format are placed in the first three positions of the new format, and the last digit of the old format will be placed in the last position of the new format. For example, the dataset ID 'ds094.1' will be converted to 'd094001', and the dataset ID 'ds351.0' will be converted to 'd351000'.** Please contact us at rdahelp@ucar.edu if you have questions regarding this update.
