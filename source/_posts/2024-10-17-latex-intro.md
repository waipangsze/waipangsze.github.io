# LaTeX

LaTeX is a software system for typesetting documents. LaTeX is widely used in academia for the communication and publication of **scientific documents and technical note-taking in many fields**, owing partially to its support for complex mathematical notation. It also has a prominent role in the preparation and publication of books and articles that contain complex multilingual materials, such as Arabic and Greek. The typesetting system offers programmable desktop publishing features and extensive facilities for automating most aspects of typesetting and desktop publishing, including numbering and cross-referencing of tables and figures, chapter and section headings, graphics, page layout, indexing and bibliographies.

Overleaf是一個雲端協作式LaTeX編輯器，可用於編寫和發佈論文。這一編輯器與很多科學雜誌出版商有合作關係，不但提供官方期刊的LaTeX模板，還能直接將文件提交至這些出版社。Overleaf由2011年兩名數學家John Hammersley和John Lees-Miller共同建立的公司WriteLaTeX Limited開發，他們憑藉自己在學術界的經驗開發了這一平台，因此Overleaf比其他LaTex編輯器更具優勢

The benefits of using Overleaf include:

- Instant access: no installation, real-time collaborative editing 
- Efficient handling complex documents: create mathematical equations and tables etc and easily manage footnotes, citations and references
- Streamline publishing workflow: allow to submit manuscript within Overleaf project
- Wide range of packages and templates: specifically made for different document types and citation styles
