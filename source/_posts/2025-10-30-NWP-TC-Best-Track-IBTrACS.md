# Version 4r01 Data 

- `csv/`
  - NetCDF is a self describing, mostly CF compliant format that uses global and variable attributes. Data are stored using the netCDF4 library.
- `netcdf/`
  - Missing data are stored as blank cells to decrease file sizes (other netCDF and shapefiles use -9999.0 for missing data).
- `shapefile/`
  - Files are available as point and line shapefiles with the usual shapefile parts (prj, shx, shp, and dbf files). File metadata (xml files) are not currently available. The CSV column description file can be referenced for the definitions of each variable.
