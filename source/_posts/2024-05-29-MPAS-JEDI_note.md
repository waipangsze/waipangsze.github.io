# Workshop

1. [2023-10 MPAS-A and MPAS-JEDI Tutorials and Workshop, National Central University (NCU)](http://www.gpsarc.ncu.edu.tw/MPAS2023/download.html)
2. [Welcome to the MPAS-JEDI tutorial practice guide, 202310NCU](https://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/projects/mpas-jedi/tutorial/202310NCU/)
   1. This web page is intended to serve as a guide through the practice exercises of this tutorial. Exercises are split into seven main sections, each of which focuses on a particular aspect of using the MPAS-JEDI data assimilation system.
