# Workshop

1. [2023-10 MPAS-A and MPAS-JEDI Tutorials and Workshop, National Central University (NCU)](http://www.gpsarc.ncu.edu.tw/MPAS2023/download.html)
2. [Welcome to the MPAS-JEDI tutorial practice guide, 202310NCU](https://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/projects/mpas-jedi/tutorial/202310NCU/)
   1. This web page is intended to serve as a guide through the practice exercises of this tutorial. Exercises are split into seven main sections, each of which focuses on a particular aspect of using the MPAS-JEDI data assimilation system.

5. [MPAS-JEDI Tutorial, Howard University | October 3-4, 2024](https://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/projects/mpas-jedi/tutorial/202410HOWARD/lectures/)
   1. [3-Overview.pdf](https://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/projects/mpas-jedi/tutorial/202410HOWARD/lectures/3-Overview.pdf)
6. [Study the MPAS model | Location: University of St Andrews, UK | Dates: June 23-27 2025](https://ncas.ac.uk/study-with-us/mpas-tutorials/)
   1. You will be taught by staff from NSF NCAR, world-leading experts in the use of these systems.
   2. You will gain **hands-on experience using MPAS-A and MPAS-JEDI in a friendly and supportive atmosphere**.
   3. You will have the opportunity to network with internationally-renowned scientists.
   4. we are preparing the **hands-on practice and some documentation to generate the static background error statistics** in upcoming tutorial in June 2025.
