# PINN

Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) represent a significant advancement in the integration of machine learning with physical laws, particularly in the context of solving differential equations. They combine traditional neural network approaches with the constraints provided by known physics, enabling more accurate modeling and predictions in various scientific fields.

# Universal Approximation Theorem

**Definition**  

The theorem states that for **any continuous function** $ f: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R} $ defined on a compact subset of $ \mathbb{R}^n $, there exists a neural network $ g $ such that the difference between $ f $ and $ g $ can be made arbitrarily small. Formally, for any $ \epsilon > 0 $, there exists a neural network with a finite number of neurons such that:

$$
| f(x) - g(x) | < \epsilon
$$

for all $ x $ in the domain of interest.

**Historical Background**  

The theorem was independently proven by George Cybenko in 1989, who focused on networks using sigmoid activation functions, and later by Kurt Hornik in 1991, who generalized it to include other activation functions like ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit). 

**Implications**  

It has profound implications for the design and understanding of neural networks:

- **Expressive Power**: It guarantees that neural networks can model complex relationships in data, making them suitable for tasks like image classification, function approximation, and more.
- **Architecture Design**: The theorem informs users about the necessary architecture (e.g., number of layers and neurons) required to achieve desired approximations.

**Limitations**  

While the UAT provides a theoretical foundation, it does not address practical aspects such as:

- **Generalization**: The ability of a network to perform well on unseen data is not guaranteed by the theorem alone. Techniques like regularization and cross-validation are necessary to improve generalization.
- **Computational Feasibility**: The theorem does not specify how to construct the network or find the optimal parameters effectively. In practice, training methods like backpropagation are used, but they may not always reach the global optimum.

Theorem 2: Suppose that $U$ is a compact set in $C[a,b]$, $f$ is a continuous functional defined on $U$, and $\sigma (x)$ is a bounded generalized sigmoidal function, then for any $\epsilon > 0$, there exist $m+1$ points $ a = x_0 <...< x_m = b$, a positive integer $N$ and constants $c_{ij}, \theta_{ij}, \xi_{ij}$, $i=1,...,N$, $j=0,1,...,m$, such that

$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{align*} 
| f(u) - \sum_{i=1}^N c_i g ( \sum_{j=0}^m \xi_{ij} u(x_{j}) + \theta_i) | &< \epsilon, \qquad \forall u \in U \\
| f(u) - \sum_{i=1}^N c_i g (\mathbf{\omega_j} \cdot \mathbf{x} + \theta_i) | &< \epsilon, \qquad \forall u \in U
\end{align*} 
\end{equation}
$$

# Definition and Functionality

PINNs are a type of **universal function approximator** that incorporates physical laws directly into the training process of neural networks. This is achieved by embedding governing equations, typically expressed as partial differential equations (PDEs), into the loss function of the network. By doing so, PINNs ensure that the solutions generated are consistent with these physical laws, which enhances the robustness and accuracy of the model even when data availability is limited

**Training Mechanism**  

The training of a PINN involves two main components:

1. **Data Loss**: The standard supervised learning approach minimizes the mean squared error (MSE) between **predicted outputs and actual data**.
2. **Physics Loss**: An additional term is introduced to the loss function that quantifies **how well the predicted outputs satisfy the governing physical equations**. This is done by computing gradients (**using automatic differentiation**) at sampled points in space and time, allowing for the evaluation of residuals from the PDEs.

This dual approach allows PINNs to **leverage both empirical data and theoretical knowledge**, making them particularly effective for problems where data is scarce or noisy.

## Challenges and Future Directions

Despite their advantages, PINNs also face challenges:

- **Computational Cost**: Training PINNs can be computationally intensive, especially when dealing with **complex geometries** or **high-dimensional problems**.
- **Generalization Limitations**: Regular PINNs typically require **retraining for different geometries or boundary conditions**, which can limit their efficiency in practical applications.

## Key Points on Using Collocation Points in PINNs

![Distributions of collocation points (t f , x f ) for the evaluation of governing equations (a) logarithmically sampled time points, and (b) uniformly sampled time points. The data sets (t o , x o ) and (t b , x b ) are also plotted.](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/354493654/figure/fig2/AS:1066347421261825@1631248445040/Distributions-of-collocation-points-t-f-x-f-for-the-evaluation-of-governing.png){width=550}

It is possible to use collocation points only in Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). Collocation points are specific locations in the domain where the residuals of the governing equations are evaluated, and they play a crucial role in training PINNs.

**1. Definition and Role**  

Collocation points serve as the training dataset for PINNs, where the network learns to **minimize the residuals of the partial differential equations (PDEs) at these discrete points**. The objective is to ensure that the neural network's output satisfies the physical laws represented by these equations at the selected collocation points.

**2. Training with Collocation Points**  

The training process involves minimizing a loss function that combines:

- **Data Loss**: Measures how well the model fits any **available observational data**.
- **Physics Loss**: Enforces that the residuals of the PDEs at the **collocation points** are minimized.

Using only collocation points can be effective, especially when there is limited observational data. However, it is essential to select these points wisely, as their distribution can significantly affect the accuracy and convergence of the solution. **Strategies such as adaptive selection of collocation points** based on residual analysis or problem-specific features can enhance performance.

**3. Limitations and Considerations**  

While using collocation points alone is feasible, there are considerations:

- **Distribution of Points**: A uniform distribution may not capture complex behaviors in certain regions of the domain effectively. **Adaptive methods that focus on areas with higher residuals or complexity** can improve training efficiency and solution accuracy.
- **Generalization**: Relying solely on collocation points may limit the model's ability to generalize across different scenarios or boundary conditions unless carefully managed.

In summary, using only collocation points in PINNs is a valid approach, but careful consideration of their selection and distribution is crucial for achieving accurate and reliable results.

## Strategies for Selecting Collocation Points

**1. Uniform Sampling**  

- **Description**: Initially, many PINNs utilize a uniform sampling strategy, distributing collocation points evenly across the domain.
- **Limitations**: This method may lead to inefficiencies, especially in complex problems where certain regions require more focus due to higher gradients or residuals.

**2. Adaptive Sampling Techniques** 

- **Dynamic Adjustment**: Adaptive strategies adjust the locations of collocation points during training based on the residuals of the PDEs. This allows the network to concentrate on areas where the solution is more complex or where errors are larger.
- **Examples**:
  - **PINNACLE Method**: This method dynamically selects collocation and experimental points by analyzing training dynamics and adjusting point locations based on performance metrics. It improves accuracy and convergence speed by focusing on regions with significant residuals.
  - **Residual-Based Sampling**: Points are selected based on the distribution of residuals, with higher densities in areas exhibiting larger errors. This method can involve **resampling after a set number of iterations to avoid local minima**.

**3. Weighting Collocation Points** 

- **Variable Influence**: Assign different weights to collocation points based on their importance, allowing the model to focus more on points with higher loss values. This approach helps prioritize learning in critical areas of the solution space.

**4. Probability Density Functions (PDFs)**  

- **Guided Distribution**: Use information from residuals to create a probability density function that guides the distribution of collocation points. This can lead to a non-uniform distribution that better captures the essential features of the solution.

**5. Hybrid Approaches**  

- Combining fixed and adaptive methods can also be beneficial. For instance, starting with uniformly distributed points and then adapting their locations based on observed performance can provide a balanced approach.

In conclusion, **selecting collocation points in PINNs is an iterative process** that can significantly impact the model's efficiency and accuracy. Adaptive methods that focus on error distribution and dynamic adjustments during training are particularly effective, as demonstrated by recent advancements like the PINNACLE method. These strategies allow for better representation of complex physical phenomena while optimizing computational resources.

  - 正问题和反问题的正经定义可以解释为：正问题，已知原因，根据已有的模型和规律，得到结果状态或者观测，而反问题则是已知结果状态或者观测，来反推原因。
  - 反问题我们定义为，已知一些场域内的观测情况，来反推最优的PDE方程的系数/参数的值（这个定义是非常狭隘的和最基本的，后面我们再延申），从某种角度来开，正问题和反问题是一套系统的共生问题
- 神经网络的可微性带来了梯度求解的可行性，而现有的pytorch等框架的autograd带来了工程上实现的便利性
- 正是由于**PDE方程已经包含了所有信息(一个世界模型)**，因此，求解正问题时，PINN完全不需要数据，只需要随意在空间和时间步上采样，然后让PDE方程来评估神经网络的建模是否准确
