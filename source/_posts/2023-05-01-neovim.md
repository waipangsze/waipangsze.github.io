# neovim

[Git neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim)

## Installation

```sh
git clone https://github.com/neovim/neovim
cd neovim 
make CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
git checkout stable

rm -r build/  # clear the CMake cache
# To install the executable to a certain location, use:
make CMAKE_EXTRA_FLAGS="-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/shells_setup/neovim"
make install
export PATH="$HOME/shells_setup/neovim/bin:$PATH"
```

make CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release/Debug/RelWithDebInfo

The build type determines the level of used compiler optimizations and debug information:
- **Release**: Full compiler optimizations and no debug information. Expect the best performance from this build type. Often used by package maintainers.
- **Debug**: Full debug information; few optimizations. Use this for development to get meaningful output from debuggers like GDB or LLDB. This is the default if CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE is not specified.
- **RelWithDebInfo** ("Release With Debug Info"): Enables many optimizations and adds enough debug info so that when Neovim ever crashes, you can still get a backtrace.
